# Makr

A place for creative people to connect and collaborate in the Thames Valley area.

This community was created to enable people in the Thames Valley region — Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, Surrey — to connect and collaborate on ideas.

Whether you're a designer, developer, photographer, artist, author, musician, or just want to connect with people near you, join the community and meet a Makr.
