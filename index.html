        This community was created to enable people in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thames_Valley" title="Thames Valley information on Wikipedia" target="_blank">Thames Valley</a> area &mdash; Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, Surrey &mdash; to connect. It's a Slack team where members can discuss events they've attended, find collaborators for side projects or simply form friendships with local people who have similar interests.
      </p>
      <p>Whether you're a designer, developer, photographer, artist, author, musician, or just want to connect with people near you, join the community and meet a Makr.</p>

        <h2>Who is it for?</h2>
        <p>The project is still in its infancy so the direction it takes will very much depend on the people involved. So far there are some designers, developers, artists, writers, engineers and even recruiters on board.</p>

        <h2>Why was Makr started?</h2>
        <p>For about two years now I've been attending local meetup's and events geared towards design and development. I'm not the most comfortable when it comes to networking and I was finding that I would attend events, hang out with the friends I went with, maybe start a conversation with the people immediately next to me, and then never follow up with any of the conversations that were started.</p>
        <p>If the speakers shared their twitter handle I would follow them and maybe tweet at them after the event but that's about as far as it goes.</p>
        <p>I started looking for any online communities of people in the local area and other than a handful of very specific Meetup groups, there was nothing. I found a bunch of Slack teams for designers and developers which I joined but I was finding that they were either too global or specific to London or San Fransisco. That's no good.</p>
        <p>By now I'd pretty much decided in my own head that I was going to try and build a local community myself. I discussed the idea with a friend of mine while attending an event and he said he felt some of the same frustrations, thus validating my idea. A few back-and-forth twitter DM's later and the idea was born.</p>
